title: 8. THE ULTIMATE END OF CREATION.
description: 
---

According to Holy Scripture the ultimate end of creation is the glory of God; in other words, the world was created ultimately for God's own sake, Prov. 16, 4, or for His glory, Ps. 104, 1 ff. For this reason not only men, but all creatures are exhorted to praise God, Ps. 148. By His creation God manifested in particular: a) His goodness, Ps. 136; b) His power, Ps. 115; c) His wisdom, Ps. 19, 1ff.; 104, 24; 136, 5. The objection offered here that it is an unworthy conception of God to regard Him as having made all things for His own glory is a) anti-Scriptural, since Holy Scripture teaches this very truth, Rom. 11, 36; b) unreasonable, since it measures God by human standards; c) atheistic, since it dethrones God and puts man in His place; for if the world was not made primarily for God's sake, then man himself must be the ultimate end of creation. However, while the ultimate end of creation is the glory of God, the intermediate end of creation is the benefit of man, Ps. 115, 15. 16. Quenstedt writes (1, 418: "God made all things for the sake of man, but man He made for His own sake, Ps. 115, 16; 60, 7. 8." Finis cuius creationis mundi gloria Dei; finis cui homo.
