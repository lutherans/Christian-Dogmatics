Modern rationalistic theology of both wings, the conservative no less than the liberalistic, demands theological progress, or doctrinal development, in accord with the advanced and ever-advancing religious vogues of the age (Lehrfortbildung). Its claim is that Christian theology cannot be stagnant, but must adjust itself to the varying views of the times. So insistent it is with regard to this matter that it brands all Christian theologians who oppose doctrinal development as unfaithful to their high commission. In modern rationalistic circles loyal theologians, who cling to Holy Scripture as the only norm of faith, are styled "repristinating theologians" (Repristinationstheologen), a term that implies both censure and contempt.

However, as a matter of fact theological progress, or doctrinal development, is impossible and must be condemned as apostasy from the Christian faith. The reason for this is obvious. According to Holy Scripture Christian theology constitutes a unit, which is complete and perfect in itself and hence incapable of either addition or subtraction. Matt. 28, 20: "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." 2 Thess. 2, 15 : "Stand fast and hold the traditions [the doctrines] which ye have been taught." Rev. 22, 18: "If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book." Christian theology, or Christian doctrine, is therefore, according to the express teachings of Holy Scripture, a fixed body of divine truths, which must never be altered, neither increased by human additions nor diminished by omissions of any kind. The Christian theologian must acknowledge and proclaim "all the counsel of God." Cp. Acts 20, 20. 21. 27: "I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God." In addition to this Holy Scripture very emphatically affirms that the Church of Christ is built "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Corner-stone," Eph. 2, 20. The "foundation of the apostles and prophets'' is the fixed doctrine which these holy men have written in Holy Writ by inspiration of the Holy Ghost. So also our Lord declares that those who are saved shall be saved through the Word of the apostles, John 17, 20. Moreover, the Word of God warns all believers most impressively against all errorists that pervert this fixed and definite Word either through addition or subtraction. Acts 20, 29: "After my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock." 1 Tim. 4, 1 : "In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils." Hence both Christ and His apostles declare that the Christian doctrine is a perfect and complete body of inspired truths, which must be preserved pure and unadulterated. Every possibility of doctrinal progress, or development, is therefore excluded. Evolution in the realm of doctrine or theology is as preposterous and unscriptural as it is in the realm of nature, or creation. Holy Scripture affirms positively that the same God who made man also gave to him the divine doctrine by which he must be saved. Over this divine doctrine man has no jurisdiction; it is God's sanctuary, which sinful man must not defile either by addition or subtraction, or, to use the modern euphemism, by doctrinal development.

To this the objection has been raised that the Christian Church has at all times actually developed the Christian doctrine by establishing creeds and confessions. But this objection involves an intolerable fallacy. In its creeds the Christian Church has never developed the Christian doctrine, but only declared the express doctrine of Holy Scripture in its full truth and purity against the errors of heretics and schismatics. Thus the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the likP., are not declarations of new, man-made teachings, but the very doctrines of Christ and His apostles set forth in Holy Scripture. Whenever the formulation of creeds necessitated the coining of terms not found in Holy Scripture (ὁμοούσιος, θεοτόκος, mere passive, etc.), this was done only to present the Scriptural doctrine in clearer light, but never to foist man-devised and unscriptural teachings upon the Christian Church. So also the particular Lutheran Confessions are only specific declarations of the Scriptural doctrine against the errors of Romanism, Calvinism, and enthusiasm. Luther writes very truthfully: "We fabricate nothing new, but retain, and hold to, the old Word of God as the ancient Church confessed it; hence we are, just like it, the true ancient Church, teaching and believing the same Word of God. For this reason the papists blaspheme Christ Himself, the apostles, and the whole Christian Church when they call us innovationists and heretics. For they find nothing with us but the old (doctrine) of the ancient Church." (St. L., XVII, 1324.)

That theological progress, or doctrinal development, is intrinsically impossible is proved experimentally by the fact that all attempts to develop the Christian doctrine have invariably led to the perversion of divine truth. Modern rationalistic theology, which champions doctrinal development as a prerequisite for the continued existence of the Church, has completely surrendered the very doctrines with which Christianity stands or falls, such as the doctrines of inspiration, of the vicarious atonement of Christ, of justification by grace alone, through faith, etc. Its doctrinal development has proved so fatal that it has virtually destroyed Christian theology and enthroned in its place a paganistic body of principles and teachings. And the reason for this is not hard to find. At the foundation of all doctrinal development lies the blind, perverse, and satanic rationalism of the carnal heart, which cannot bear the sound doctrine of God's holy Word and consequently is determined to teach what is opposed to the saving truth which is in Christ Jesus. Our divine Lord condemned this rationalistic spirit of unbelief when He told the Pharisees: "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father of it,'' John 8, 44. Let the Christian theologian remember that the Christian religion is the absolute religion, which is so complete and perfect in itself that St. Paul could write: "But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed," Gal. 1, 8. If sound Biblical theology must go by the name of "repristination theology," then let the Christian theologian glory in that term. For that is the only kind of theology which deserves a place in the Christian Church, since it is the only kind of theology which Jesus Christ, the Head and King of the Church, recognizes as true and divine. May God in His mercy retain in His Church "repristinating theologians"! For they are theologians after His heart, whom He will honor and glorify throughout eternity as the t.rue builders of His Zion.
