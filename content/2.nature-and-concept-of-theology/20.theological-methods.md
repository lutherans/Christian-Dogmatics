In the presentation of the dogmatic material Lutheran divines have employed, in the main, two methods, the synthetic and the analytic. The synthetic method proceeds from cause to effect, while the analytic method pursues the opposite course, from effect to cause. Synthetically arranged, the dogmatic grouping presents, first, God as the Cause and Principle of all things created; next, the means by which sinful and apostate mankind is brought back to communion with God; and lastly, the glorious salvation itself to which the believer attains. Analytically, the dogmatic material would be grouped as follows : Salvation, as the final objective of man; next, the means by which salvation is attained; and lastly, God as the divine Giver and Author of salvation.

The analytical method has been preferred by the later theologians of the Lutheran Church for the avowed reason that theology, being a practical subject, should first present man's final goal as the vital idea in Christian doctrine. After all, however, the grouping of the doctrinal material is of little consequence as long as Holy Scripture is recognized as the only source and standard of faith, from which alone the theologian must draw his teachings. If the doctrine is taken from any other source than Holy Scripture, either method is equally unsatisfactory; if the theologian remains loyal to God's Word, both methods may be employed with equal success. In the final analysis, not the method of presenting the theological material, but faithfulness to Scripture, is the prime requisite of a good dogmatic treatise.

The synthetic method was commonly used within the Lutheran Church by the early dogmaticians, such as Melanchthon, Chemnitz, Hutter, Gerhard. The analytic method was followed by Dannhauer, Koenig, Calov, Quenstedt, Baier, Hollaz, and others. Occasionally we find a combination of the two methods. The time is past when a dogmatic treatise is judged by its method, though a modified form of the synthetic method perhaps is now given the preference. But what the Christian Church must demand of all dogmatic treatises or books is a clear, thorough, and practical presentation of the Scriptural truths. The only theology which deserves a place in Christ's Church is the sacred theology which God Himself has given in Holy Scripture. From this surpassing treasure of divine truth the Christian theologian dare not deviate in the slightest; if he does, he is disloyal to the charge entrusted to him. In his system of theology the two distinctive principles of the Christian faith, the sola Scriptura and the sola gratia, must stand preeminent; otherwise his entire theology becomes rationalistic, paganistic, and destructive, a disgrace to the name of Christ and a menace to His Church. Quod non est biblicum, non est theologicum. All dogma that is not founded upon this axiom does not deserve the name of Christian theology.
