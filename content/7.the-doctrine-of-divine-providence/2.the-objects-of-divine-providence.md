title: 2. THE OBJECTS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE.
description: 
---

According to Holy Scripture divine providence embraces not only the universe in general, Col. 1, 17, but also all creatures individually: a) plants, Matt. 6, 28-30; b) animals, Matt. 6, 26; c) men, Acts 17, 26; Ps. 33, 12-15. The special object of divine providence according to Scripture is the Christian Church, for whose sake all things exist and whose welfare all must serve, Rom. 8, 28; Reb. 1, 14; Matt. 16, 18. All objections raised against the Scriptural truth that divine providence embraces all things, even the least, Matt. 10, 30; Luke 21, 18; 12, 6, for example, that God would be too heavily burdened by caring for all things or that the small affairs of life in that case would receive undue emphasis in comparison with the important matters, must be rejected as perverse notions of the carnal and unbelieving heart, which destroy the very concept of God; for just because God is God, does He care for all things, Acts 17, 28.
