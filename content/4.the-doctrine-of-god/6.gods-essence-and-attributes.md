## THE DOCTRINE IN GENERAL
Holy Scripture describes God as the Supreme Being ( efl8 omnium excellentissimum) or as the absolutely Perfect Essence ( Deut. 10, 17: "God of gods and Lord of lords"; 1 Tim. 6, 15. 16: "the blessed and only Potentate," ,uovo~ bvvaoT1J~), or simply as the Absolute Being (ens primum), who "is before all things" and by whom "all things consist," Col. 1, 17. At times Scripture applies the name god or gods to creatures ( dii nuncupativi, ltyopE)Iot {hoi), either because they perform real (John 10, 35 ; Ps. 82, 6) or supposed (Deut. 4, 28) divine functions, and are therefore vested either rightly or wrongly with divine authority ( 1 Cor. 8, 5, propter analogiam quandam, vel veram, vel fictam). Nevertheless Scripture distinguishes clearly between the so-called gods ( dii nuncupativi) and the one, true, and living God, 1 Cor. 8, 5. 6; Matt. 19, 17. Magistrates (Ps. 82, 6) and idols (Deut. 4, 28) are indeed called gods (C';:i'~Â· 1Jto{), but God alone is Jehovah (Mjn> nomen Dei essentiale et incommunicabile).
