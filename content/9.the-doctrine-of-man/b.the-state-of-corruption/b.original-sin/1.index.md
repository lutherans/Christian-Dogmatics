Original sin (peccatum originale), or the state of depravity, which followed Adam's transgression and which now inheres in all his posterity, embraces a) hereditary guilt (culpa hereditaria) and b) hereditary corruption (corruptio hereditaria). That the guilt of Adam is imputed to all his descendants is taught in Rom. 5, 18: "By the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation"; v. 19: "By one man's disobedience many were made sinners." The hereditary corruption of all descendants of Adam is clearly taught in Ps. 51, 5: "I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me"; John 3, 6 : "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." That the word flesh (σάρξ) here denotes corruption (corrupt flesh) is proved by v. 5 : "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore the term is here used precisely as in Rom. 8, 7: "the carnal mind" (τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς). According to Scripture, God, then, imputes (חָשַׁב, λογίζεται) the guilt of Adam to all his descendants (Rom. 5, 12: "for that, ἐφ’ ᾧ, all have sinned").
