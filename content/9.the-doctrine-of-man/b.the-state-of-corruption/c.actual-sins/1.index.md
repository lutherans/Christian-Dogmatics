By actual sin (peccatum actuals) we understand all lawlessness (ἀνομία) which is done, or committed. It thus stands in contradistinction to that avo,uia which all men inherit from their parents through their sinful birth (quae in omnes homines per carnalem generationem derivatur) and on account of which they are condemned as sinners (imputatio peccati Adamitici: corruptio hereditaria), even when they have not yet broken the divine Law through transgression of individual commandments, Rom. 5, 19. Or, more briefly described: "Actual transgression is every act, whether external or internal, which conflicts with the Law of God." (Hutter.) Luther very fittingly calls original sin "person sin," "nature sin," or "essential sin," because it is "not a sin which is committed," but one which "inheres in the nature, substance, and essence of man, so that, though no wicked thought ever should arise in the heart of corrupt man, no idle word were spoken, no wicked deed were done, yet the nature is nevertheless corrupted through original sin." (Formula of Concord, Epit., I, 21.) Actual sins are divided into sins of commission and omission, that is, sins which occur by doing (agendo) what the divine Law prohibits or by omitting (omittendo) what the divine Law commands. For this reason Hollaz defines actual sin thus: "Actual sin is a turning away, by a human act either of commission or omission, from the rule of the divine Law, incurring responsibility for guilt (reatus culpae) and liability to punishment (reatus poenae) ." ( Doctr. Theol., p. 252.)
