title: 5. THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF TEMPTATION.
description: 
---

According to Scripture there is a) a temptation for good (tentatio probationis) and b) a temptation for evil (tentatio seductionis). The first comes from God and is designed for the trial and strengthening of faith, Gen. 22, 1-18; Deut. 13, 1 fi.; Ps. 66, 10f. By sending tentationes probationis upon His children, God does not become the author of sin; for a) He proportions all trials to the strength of His saints, 1 Cor. 10, 13, and b) sustains His beloved most graciously in their faith whenever they are tempted, Luke 22, 31. 32; 1 Cor. 10, 13. For this reason those who resist and overcome temptation do so not by their own strength or worthiness, but solely by the grace of God, Rom. 11, 20-22; 2 Cor. 12, 9.

Temptations for evil (tentationes seductionis) come a) from the devil, Matt. 4, 1 ff.; 1 Pet. 5, 8; b) from the world, 1 John 2, 15-1 ";; and c) from the flesh, Jas. 1, 14; cf. 1 Thess. 3, 5; 1 Cor. 7, 5; 1 Tim. 6, 9; Mark 14, 38. It is of great comfort to all believers that Christ, who Himself was tempted, has promised to sustain His followers in their temptations, Reb. 2, 18; 4, 15; 2 Pet. 2, 9.
