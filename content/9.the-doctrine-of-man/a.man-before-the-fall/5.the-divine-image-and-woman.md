title: 5. THE DIVINE IMAGE AND WOMAN.
description: 
---

Not only Adam, but also Eve possessed the divine image. This is clear a) from Gen. 1, 27; b) from Col. 3, 10; Eph. 4, 24, compared with Gal. 3, 28; for with regard to the renewal after the image of God there is no difference between male and female; and c) from Gen. 1, 28, where dominion is ascribed to the woman as well as to the man. Nevertheless the woman in her relation to the man occupied a position of subjection even before the Fall; for not only was she taken from man, but she was also created as his helpmeet, Gen. 2, 18-22; 1 Cor. 11, 7-9; 1 Tim. 2, 11-13.

This divine order must not be subverted; for it is the will of God that the woman should not usurp authority over the man by ruling over him. But, on the other hand, the woman should not be tyrannized or made a slave; for though she was not taken from the head of Adam to govern him, yet neither was she taken from his feet to be trodden under by him. Luther says : "Woman should be regarded with reverence; for she is God's handiwork. She was created that she might be a helpmeet for her husband, bring up children, and rear them in faith and piety." Both the man and the woman serve best in that relation or sphere in which God has created each, Eph. 5, 21-33; Titus 2, 3-5; 1 Cor. 7, 20, whereas the abrogation of the divine order will result in confusion and injury for human society, Prov. 1, 24-33. (Cp. Luther, St. L., V, 1517; II, 540; II, 687; XVI, 2280.)
