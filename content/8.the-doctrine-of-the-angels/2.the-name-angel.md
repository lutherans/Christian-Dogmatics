title: 2. THE NAME "ANGEL."
description: 
---

The term angel (מַלְאָךְ, ἄγγελος), by which Holy Scripture designates this class of creatures, does not describe their essence, but their office (nomen officii) and signifies "one sent," or a messenger. The nature of the angels is described by the term spirit (πνεύμα). That the name angel is a designation of office is clear from the fact that Scripture ascribes it a) to ministers of the divine Word, Mal. 2, 7; Matt. 11, 10, and b) to the Son of GOO, the "uncreated Angel," as the supreme and unique Messenger of God, Mal. 3, 1; John 3, 17. 34; Is. 63, 9; Gen. 48, 16, etc. The important question, "When does the Scriptural expression Angel of the Lord (מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה) denote the Angelus increatus, or Christ?" our dogmaticians answer as follows: "Whenever the name Jehovah or divine works and worship are ascribed to the Angel in Scripture, then this Angel must be understood to be the Son of God."
